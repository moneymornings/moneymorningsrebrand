   ```

## 🔐 **Security Best Practices**

### **IMMEDIATELY Change Default Password**
When deploying to production:
```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-secure-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-very-secure-password
```

### **Strong Password Guidelines**:
- ✅ At least 12 characters
- ✅ Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- ✅ Unique password not used elsewhere
- ✅ Not related to your business name

**Example strong passwords**:
- `SecureAdmin@2025#MM!`
- `MM_Dashboard_Secure_789`
- `MyAdmin$Pass2025!`

## 📧 **Email Setup (After Deployment)**

To receive email notifications:
1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on Gmail
2. **Create App Password**:
   - Google Account → Security → App passwords
   - Generate 16-character password
3. **Add to Railway Environment**:
   ```
   SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
   ```

## 🎯 **What Happens When Someone Applies**

1. **Customer fills form** on your website
2. **Data immediately saved** to your database
3. **You get notified** (email when configured)
4. **View in admin dashboard** instantly
5. **Contact qualified applicants** directly
6. **Track application status** through pipeline

## ⚠️ **Important Security Notes**

### **NEVER**:
- Share admin credentials with anyone
- Access admin on public/unsecured networks
- Leave admin dashboard open unattended
- Use the default password in production

### **ALWAYS**:
- Change default password before going live
- Use HTTPS in production (automatic with Railway/Vercel)
- Log out when finished with admin tasks
- Keep credentials in secure password manager
